# Corporation-Favorita-Sales-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Regression-Analysis-

Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, wants to ensure that they always have the right quantity of products in stock. This is a time series regression analysis problem. We will build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

### Objective

The objective is to build machine learning models that can predict unit sales for different product families at Favorita stores accurately. These models will help optimize inventory levels, improve sales forecasting accuracy, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability.

### Key Stakeholders

Corporation Favorita: The grocery retailer seeking to optimize its stock management and sales forecasting.
Marketing and Sales Team: Provide data and insights to aid in the development of the forecasting models.
Data Scientists: Responsible for building the machine learning models and analyzing the date.

### Key Metrics and Success Criteria

- Achieve a 0.2 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) in sales forecasting models.
- Improve inventory management efficiency and reduce stockout instances.
- Accuracy of Sales Predictions
- Efficiency of Stock Management
- Impact on Profitability

#### Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (Ho): Promotional activties do not have a significant effect on the sales

Alternate Hypothesis (Ha): Promotionnal activities have a significant effect on the sales

### Analytical Business Questions

1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?
2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year (excluding days the store was closed)?
3. Compare the sales for each month across the years and determine which month of which year had the highest sales.
4. Did the earthquake impact sales?
5. Are certain stores or groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)
6. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?
7. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?
8. Which product family and stores did the promotions affect.
9. What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)
10. Does the payment of wages in the public sector on the 15th and last days of the month influence the store sales.
